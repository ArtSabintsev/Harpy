# Harpy
### Notify users when a new version of your iOS app is available, and prompt them with the App Store link.

---
### About (current release: v2.3.7)
**Harpy** is a utility that checks a user's currently installed version of your iOS application against the version that is currently available in the AppStore. If a new version is available, an instance of UIAlertView is presented to the user informing them of the newer version, and giving them the option to update the application.

### Features
- Three types of alerts to present to the end-user (see **Screenshots** section)
- Optional delegate and delegate methods (see **Optional Delegate** section)
- Cocoapods Support
- Localized for 14 languages: Basque, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish

### Screenshots

- The **left picture** forces the user to update the app.
- The **center picture** gives the user the option to update the app.
- The **right picture** gives the user the skip the current update.
- This option is based on the `HarpyAlertType` struct that is found in `Harpy.h`.

![Optional Update](https://github.com/ArtSabintsev/Harpy/blob/master/picOptionalUpdate.png?raw=true "Optional Update")

### Installation Instructions
**Note: Harpy utilizes ARC. Add the *-fobjc-arc* compiler flag in the build phases tab if your project doesn't use ARC**.

1. Copy the 'Harpy' folder into your Xcode project.
1. Import **Harpy.h** into your AppDelegate or Pre-Compiler Header (.pch)
1. In your `AppDelegate`, set the **appID**, and optionally, you can set the **alertType**.
1. In your `AppDelegate`, call **only one** of the `checkVersion` methods, as all three perform a check on your application's first launch. Use either:
    - `checkVersion` in `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`
    - `checkVersionDaily` in `applicationDidBecomeActive:`.
    - `checkVersionWeekly` in `applicationDidBecomeActive:`.
	
``` obj-c
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{

	// Present Window before calling Harpy
	[self.window makeKeyAndVisible]
	
	// Set the App ID for your app
	[[Harpy sharedInstance] setAppID:@"<app_id>"];
	
	/* (Optional) Set an alternative name for your app
	 This might be useful if the bundle is just an abreviation for example.
	 By default, the application bundle name will be used. */
	[[Harpy sharedInstance] setAppName:@"<app_name>"];
	
	/* (Optional) Set the Alert Type for your app 
	 By default, the Singleton is initialized to HarpyAlertTypeOption */
	[[Harpy sharedInstance] setAlertType:<alert_type>];
	
	/* (Optional) If your application is not availabe in the U.S. Store, you must specify the two-letter
	 country code for the region in which your applicaiton is available in. */
	[[Harpy sharedInstance] setCountryCode:@"<countryCode>"]; 
	
	// Perform check for new version of your app 
	[[Harpy sharedInstance] checkVersion]; 
}

- (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application
{

	/*
	 Perform daily check for new version of your app
	 Useful if user returns to you app from background after extended period of time
 	 Place in applicationDidBecomeActive:
 	 
 	 Also, performs version check on first launch.
 	*/
	[[Harpy sharedInstance] checkVersionDaily];

	/*
	 Perform weekly check for new version of your app
	 Useful if user returns to you app from background after extended period of time
	 Place in applicationDidBecomeActive:
	 
	 Also, performs version check on first launch.
	 */
	[[Harpy sharedInstance] checkVersionWeekly];
    
}
```

And you're all set!

### Optinonal Delegate and Delegate Methods
If you'd like to handle or track the end-user's behavior, four delegate methods have been made available to you:

```	obj-c

	// User presented with update dialog
	- (void)harpyDidShowUpdateDialog;
	
	// User did click on button that launched App Store.app
	- (void)harpyUserDidLaunchAppStore;
	
	// User did click on button that skips version update
	- (void)harpyUserDidSkipVersion;
	
	// User did click on button that cancels update dialog
	- (void)harpyUserDidCancel;

```

### Important Note on AppStore Submissions
- The AppStore reviewer will **not** see the alert. 

###  Release Notes (v2.3.7)
- Xcode 5 can now properly displays header-file method comments in quick-help window. You must manually enable *-Weverything* to see these comments.
