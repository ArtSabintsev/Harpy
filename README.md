# Harpy

## Notify users that a new version of your app is available in the AppStore

### About
**Harpy** is a utility that checks a user's currently installed version of your iOS application against the version that is currently available in the AppStore. If a new version is available, an instance of UIAlertView is presented to the user informing them of the newer version, and giving them the option to update the application.

### Features
- Three types of alerts to present to the end-user (see **Screenshots** section)
- Optional delegate and delegate methods (see **Optional Delegate** section)
- Cocoapods Support
- Localized for 14 languages
	- Basque
	- Chinese (Simplified)
	- Chinese (Traditional)
	- Danish
	- Dutch
	- English
	- French
	- German
	- Italian
	- Japanese
	- Korean
	- Portuguese
	- Russian
	- Spanish

### Screenshots

- The **left picture** forces the user to update the app.
- The **center picture** gives the user the option to update the app.

![Optional Update](https://github.com/ArtSabintsev/Harpy/blob/master/picOptionalUpdate.png?raw=true "Optional Update")

### Installation Instructions
**Note: Harpy utilizes ARC. Add the *-fobjc-arc* compiler flag in the build phases tab if your project doesn't use ARC**.

1. Copy the 'Harpy' folder into your Xcode project.

1. Import **Harpy.h** into your AppDelegate or Pre-Compiler Header (.pch)

1. In your `AppDelegate`, set the `appID` for your app: `[[Harpy sharedInstance] setAppID:@"<app_id>"]`.

1. In your `AppDelegate`, set the `alertType` for your app: `[[Harpy sharedInstance] setAlertType:<alert_type>]`.

1.  In your `AppDelegate`, add **only one** of the `[[Harpy sharedInstance] checkVersion]` methods.	
	- **NOTE: Call only one of the Harpy methods, as they all perform a check on your application's first launch. Using multiple methods will result in multiple UIAlertViews to pop.**
	
``` obj-c
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{

	// Present Window before calling Harpy
	[self.window makeKeyAndVisible]
	
	// Set the App ID for your app
	[[Harpy sharedInstance] setAppID:@"<app_id>"];
	
	/* (Optional) Set the Alert Type for your app 
	 By default, the Singleton is initialized to HarpyAlertTypeOption */
	[[Harpy sharedInstance] setAlertType:<alert_type>];
	
	// Perform check for new version of your app 
	[[Harpy sharedInstance] checkVersion] 
}

- (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application
{

	/*
	 Perform daily check for new version of your app
	 Useful if user returns to you app from background after extended period of time
 	 Place in applicationDidBecomeActive:
 	 
 	 Also, performs version check on first launch.
 	*/
	[[Harpy sharedInstance] checkVersionDaily];

	/*
	 Perform weekly check for new version of your app
	 Useful if user returns to you app from background after extended period of time
	 Place in applicationDidBecomeActive:
	 
	 Also, performs version check on first launch.
	 */
	[[Harpy sharedInstance] checkVersionWeekly];
    
}
```

And you're all set!

### Optinonal Delegate and Delegate Methods
If you'd like to handle or track the end-user's behavior, four delegate methods have been made available to you:

```	obj-c

	// User presented with update dialog
	- (void)harpyDidShowUpdateDialog;
	
	// User did click on button that launched App Store.app
	- (void)harpyUserDidLaunchAppStore;
	
	// User did click on button that skips version update
	- (void)harpyUserDidSkipVersion;
	
	// User did click on button that cancels update dialog
	- (void)harpyUserDidCancel;

```

### Important Note on AppStore Submissions
- The AppStore reviewer will **not** see the alert.
